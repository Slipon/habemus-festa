    <string name="text_terms_and_conditions_title">Terms and Conditions</string>

    <string name="text_terms_and_conditions">Welcome to Habemus Festa\n
         These terms and conditions define the rules and regulations for using the android application.
        By accessing this application, we assume that you accept these terms and conditions in full. Do not continue to use it if you do not accept all the terms and services referred to on this page.
        All terms refer to the offer, acceptance and consideration of data entry necessary to carry out the process of our application in the most appropriate manner.
        \n\n
        Product Information and Content\n\n
        Habemus Festa will do everything possible to ensure that the information presented does not contain typographical errors, which will be quickly corrected whenever they occur.
        Habemus Festa will do everything possible to manage any and all types of new integration of common users or collaborators, with the first being the users of the points awarded and the second being the ones who debit the points. Points that arise after contacting other users to exchange mutual points through social contact, and this attribution of points is also present in the entries of any upcoming event.
        Any user who has a consumer sales service at the event must register as a collaborator in order to be assigned a different profile as well as usage data.
        The exchange of points will be present for use in any event services such as food, drinks and merchandising. Points will be unlimited and valid for each event, meaning that they can be carried to the next event, accumulating an opportunity to exchange for any of the services described above.
        In an event, it is not mandatory that all employees be added to the service of our application, so they may find employees with products that can be exchanged for points, others with exchange of points and with payment of added value.
        Any and all employee services that do not intend to be part of the exchange of points cannot be accepted as an official employee of Habemus Festa.
        \n\nLicense\n\n
        As the application is developed in the context of the school process, it does not have any type of legislation yet added as it is an academic end-of-course project.
        \n\nNotice\n\n
        To the extent that the application, information and services are provided free of charge, we will not be liable for any loss or damage of any kind.
        \n\n
        Privacy and Personal Data Protection\n\n
        Habemus Festa guarantees the confidentiality of all data provided by Users.
        Personal data identified in the user/employee profile as being mandatory are essential for the provision of the Service by Habemus Festa. The omission or inaccuracy of the data provided by the User is their sole and entire responsibility and may give rise to the refusal to provide the Service by Habemus Festa.
        The User\'s personal data will be processed and stored by computer and are intended to be used in the context of the commercial relationship with the User as an intermediary for the event.
        \n\nCommunications\n\n
        Whenever Habemus Festa deems it necessary or convenient to optimize the browsing experience and/or improve connectivity conditions, it may reformulate the network configurations.
        Application waiver
        At any time, the user can revoke his registration in the application, having continued as a user or already a collaborator without penalty of being subject to any additional penalty. Any number of points that each user has will be lost and in the case of employees, in addition to no longer taking part in the events as service providers, they also lose their registration as users.
